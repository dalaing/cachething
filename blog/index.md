### Overview

This is a playground for a few ideas for working with referential data - sets of data types with IDs that refer to one another.

Part of it will be about reading the data in a la `haxl`, part of it will be about querying and transforming the data, and part of it will be about writing the changes out again.

There are plenty of potential adventures to be had here, and I'll be diving into all of the various pieces of this that don't blow up too badly when I get around to poking at them.
